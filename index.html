                Your smile feels like sunrise in human form. The kind that does not just light up a room, 
                but gently rearranges something inside my heart and soul. 
                When you smile, I forget what sadness even sounds like. It’s soft, warm, and dangerous in the best way… 
                because every time I see it, I fall all over again. I don’t just love your smile — I love the way it quietly owns my heart.

                You don’t try to be beautiful. You simply are. And somehow, effortlessly, you became the most beautiful person in my world.

               You show up with warmth even when you don’t have to.

                Watching you exist with grace and resilience makes me admire you more every single day. You inspire me. You are my Muse.

                It’s the little things you do that quietly steal my heart. 
                The small smiles. The tiny reactions. The way you say certain words. The way you look when you’re thinking. 
                You probably don’t even notice these moments… but I collect them like treasures. 
                Because loving you lives in the details.

               Your energy isn’t just something I notice… it’s something I feel deep inside my soul. Being around you feels like being wrapped in something familiar, powerful, and beautiful. You don’t just exist, you glow.
